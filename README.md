# Pandas Tutorial: Creating Data Structures
In this tutorial, we will learn about how to create these data structures.
<br> Pandas has three main data structures:
- **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type. A series is similar with one-dimensional NumPy array, but indexed. 
- **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional labeled array with columns of potentially different types. A dataframe can be seen as an indexed two-dimensional NumPy array. It is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. 
- **Panel**: A three-dimensional data container.

All Pandas data structures are value mutable. 
<br>In this tutorial, we focus on series and dataframe, which are the most commonly used data structures.
